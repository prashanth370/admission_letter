# Admission Letter Markup Project
This project involves creating the markup of an admission response letter from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student. The markup is structured to include both block and inline semantics and will be hosted on a university intranet. It includes a number of semantic elements, heading structures, lists, addresses, and other inline elements to ensure proper formatting and accessibility.

# Project Overview
The project focuses on the semantic HTML markup of the letter with the following key features:

# Document Structure: 
1) Use of the <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> elements to structure the document.
# Headings: 
2) The document has one top-level heading for the "Re:" line and three second-level headings.
# Lists: 
3) Appropriate lists are used for semester start dates, study subjects, and exotic dances.
# Address Elements: 
4) The addresses are marked up using the <address> tag, with lines separated without using paragraphs.
# Inline Semantics: 
5) Marked up names, dates, and acronyms/abbreviations for improved accessibility and clarity.
# Superscripts/Subscripts: 
6) Appropriate markup for chemical formulas and powers.
# Hyperlinks: 
7) Two hyperlinks with titles for demonstration purposes.
